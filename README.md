## Start
Let's start up the server, run:
`gulp` or `gulp serve-dev`

All the `.js` files are ignored and should't be uploaded to the repository.

## I18n
There's a directive to translate the strings in the html files, just do something like this

```html
<p i18n="my.key">fallback string</p>
```

## Testing
This starter comes with testing gulp workflow

### Unit testing
Just run
```bash
gulp test
```

### E2E testing
Firstly start the server:
```
gulp serve-dev
```
To begin testing, run:
```bash
gulp e2e
```

## Production
> All build tasks will run the `gulp test`, the bundle will only be created if the test passed.

You can create production build by running:
```bash
gulp build
```
or you can create production build and then serve it using Browsersync by running:
```bash
gulp serve-build
```
